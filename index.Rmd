# Science

- A set of logical, systematic, documented methods for investigating nature and natural processes; the knowledge produced by these investigations.<sup>2</sup>

--

# Social Science

- The use of scientific methods to investigate individuals, societies, and social processes; the knowledge produced by these investigations.<sup>2</sup>

---

# What is research?

- "Just close your eyes for a minute and utter the word research to yourself."<sup>1</sup>

--

- "questions about the world and a desire to accurately answer them" <sup>2</sup>

--

- "steps from broad assumptions to detailed methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation" <sup>3</sup>

.green[We need to move beyond first impressions and get reactions to more systematic methods of investigation. Thatâ€™s what social research does."]<sup>2</sup>

# Social science methods help to avoid<sup>2</sup> :

-  `Overgeneralization:` Occurs when we unjustifiably conclude that what is true for some cases is true for all cases

--

- `Selective or Inaccurate Observation:` Choosing to look only at things that are in line with our preferences or beliefs.

--

-  `Illogical reasoning:` The premature jumping to conclusions or arguing on the basis of invalid assumptions.

--

- `Resistance to change:` The reluctance to change our ideas in light of new information.

# Four goals of social research are<sup>2</sup>:

1. `Description:` Research in which social phenomena are defined and described.

--

1. `Exploration:` Seeks to find out how people get along in the setting under question, what meanings they give to their actions, and what issues concern them. 

--

1. `Explanation:` Seeks to identify causes and effects of social phenomena and to predict how one phenomenon will change or vary in response to variation in another phenomenon.

--

1. `Evaluation:` Research that describes or identifies the impact of social policies and programs.

---

# How well have we done our research?

- `Validity:` The state that exists when statements or conclusions about empirical reality are correct.



---

  - Measurement validity: Exists when an indicator measures what we think it measures.
  - Generalizability
  - Causal validity
