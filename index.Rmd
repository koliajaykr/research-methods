# Social science methods help to avoid<sup>2</sup> :

-  `Overgeneralization:` Occurs when we unjustifiably conclude that what is true for some cases is true for all cases

--

- `Selective or Inaccurate Observation:` Choosing to look only at things that are in line with our preferences or beliefs.

--

-  `Illogical reasoning:` The premature jumping to conclusions or arguing on the basis of invalid assumptions.

# Four goals of social research are<sup>2</sup>:

1. `Description:` Research in which social phenomena are defined and described.

--

1. `Exploration:` Seeks to find out how people get along in the setting under question, what meanings they give to their actions, and what issues concern them. 

--

1. `Explanation:` Seeks to identify causes and effects of social phenomena and to predict how one phenomenon will change or vary in response to variation in another phenomenon.

--

1. `Evaluation:` Research that describes or identifies the impact of social policies and programs.

---

# How well have we done our research?

- `Validity:` The state that exists when statements or conclusions about empirical reality are correct.

--

- Three kinds of validity:
  - `Measurement validity`: Exists when an indicator measures what we think it measures.

--

  - `Causal validity` (Internal validity): Exists when a conclusion that A leads to, or results in, B is correct.
  
--

  - `Generalizability`: Exists when a conclusion holds true for the population, group, settings, or event that we say it does, given the conditions that we specify; it is the extent to which a study can inform us about persons, places, or events that were not directly studies.

# The Research Topic

- "the central idea to learn about or to explore"

--

- My study is about ...

--

- Pose the topic as a brief question:

  - What treatment is best for depression?
  - What does it mean to be Dalit in Indian society today?
  - What brings people to cities in India?

---

# The Research Topic

### .orange[a new perspective or “angle” to the existing literature]

--

  - Studying an unusual location (e.g., caste in America)

--
  
  - Examining an unusual group of participants (e.g., refugees)

--

  - Taking a perspective that may not be expected and reverses the expectation (e.g., why marriages do work rather than do not work)
  
--

  - Providing novel means of collecting data (e.g., collect sounds)
  
--

  - Presenting results in unusual ways (e.g., graphs that depict geographical locations)
  
--

  - Studying a timely topic (e.g., agriculture laws, Dalits in Indian cinema)

---

# Social research question:

A question about the social world that is answered through the collection and analysis of first-hand, verifiable, empirical data.

---

# "Good" research question:

- `Feasibility` - Can you start and finish an investigation of your research question with available resources and in the time allotted?

--

- `Social importance` - Will an answer to your research question make a difference in the social world, even if it only helps people understand a problem they consider important? 

--

- `Scientific relevance` - Does your research question help resolve some contradictory research findings or a puzzling issue in social theory?

---

# Literature Review

- "literature review helps to determine whether the topic is .orange[worth studying], and it provides insight into ways in which the researcher can .orange[limit the scope] to a needed area of inquiry."

--

- "to consider whether the .orange[research topic] can and should be researched"

---

# Purposes of Literature Review:

- It shares with the reader the results of other studies that are .orange[closely related] to the one being undertaken. 

--

- It relates a study to the larger, .orange[ongoing dialogue] in the literature, filling in gaps and extending prior studies

--

- It provides a framework for establishing the importance of the study as well as a benchmark for .orange[comparing the results] with other findings.

---

# Four types of literature reviews are:

1. Integrate what others have done and said,

--

1. Criticize previous scholarly works, 

--

1. Build bridges between related topics, and 

--

1. Identify the central issues in a field.

---

# Conducting a Literature Review

1. Begin by identifying key words

--

1. Searching the databases like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), Web of Science, EBSCO, ProQuest, and JSTOR or you can also use website like [Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/) to download books and papers.

--

1. Skim this initial group of articles or chapters, and collect those that are central to your topic.

--

1. Designing a .orange[literature map] ... a visual picture of groupings of the literature on the topic that illustrates how your particular study will add to the existing literature and position your study within the larger body of research.

---

# .left[Measurement]

---

# Concept

- A mental image that summarizes a set of similar observations, feelings, or ideas.

--

- Defining concepts clearly can be difficult because many concepts have several meanings and can be measured in many ways. Example family, caste, social capital etc.

--

- .orange[Conceptualization]: working out what your key terms will mean in your research - is a crucial part of the research process.

# Variable

- A characteristic or property that can vary (take on different values or attributes).

---

# Steps to find variables:

1. .orange[Examine the theories] that are relevant to our research question to identify those concepts that would be expected to have some bearing on the phenomenon we are investigating.

--

1. .orange[Review the relevant research literature], and assess the utility of variables used in prior research.

--

1. .orange[Consider the constraints and opportunities] for measurement that are associated with the specific setting(s) we will study. 
--

1. .orange[Look ahead to our analysis] of the data. What role will each variable play in our analysis?

# Levels of Measurement:

1. .orange[Nominal level of measurement]: Variables whose values have no mathematical interpretation; they vary in kind or quality but not in amount.

--

1. .orange[Ordinal level of measurement]:
A measurement of a variable in which the numbers indicating a variable’s values specify only the order of the cases, permitting greater than and less than distinctions.

--

1. .orange[Interval level of measurement]: A measurement of a variable in which the numbers indicating a variable’s values represent fixed measurement units but have no absolute, or fixed, zero point.

--

1. .orange[Ratio level of measurement]: A measurement of a variable in which the numbers indicating the variable’s values represent fixed measuring units and an absolute zero point.

# .left[Sampling]

---

##- “You don’t have to eat the whole tub of butter to know if it’s rancid.” Harsh, but true.

--

##- That is the essence of sampling: A small portion, carefully chosen, can reveal the quality of a much larger whole.

--

##- Sampling techniques tell us how to select cases that can lead to valid generalizations about a population

.footnote[
Slides from chapter 5 from book Chambliss, D. F., & Schutt, R. K. (2018). Making sense of the social world: Methods of investigation. Sage Publications.
]

---

#  Population:

- The entire set of individuals or other entities to which study findings are to be generalized.

--

## Sample:

- A subset of a population used to study the population as a whole.

--

### .orange[Sampling Bias] 

- Sampling bias occurs when some population characteristics are overrepresented or underrepresented in the sample because of particular features of the method of selecting the sample.

---

class: hide-logo

```{r fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bias.png")
```


---

# Assess the Diversity of the Population

- Sampling is unnecessary if all the units in the population are identical.

--

- .orange[Representative sample]: A sample that “looks like” the population from which it was selected in all respects that are potentially relevant to the study. The distribution of characteristics among the elements of a representative sample is the same as the distribution of those characteristics among the total population. In an unrepresentative sample, some characteristics are overrepresented or underrepresented.

--

- .orange[Consider a Census]: Research in which information is obtained through responses from or information about all available members of an entire population.

---

# What sampling method should we use?

.pull-left[
## Probability sampling methods:

- Sampling methods that rely on a random, or chance, selection method so that the probability of selection of population elements is known.

]

--

.pull-right[
## Nonprobability sampling methods:

- Sampling methods in which the probability of selection of population elements is unknown.
]

---

# Qualitative methods:

- Methods, such as participant observation, intensive interviewing, and focus groups, that are designed to capture social life as participants experience it rather than in categories the researcher predetermines. 

--

- These methods typically involve .orange[exploratory research questions], inductive reasoning, an orientation to social context, and a focus on .orange[human subjectivity] and the meanings participants attach to events and to their lives.

---

# Ethnography:

- The study and systematic recording of human cultures.

```{r out.width="35%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/science-technology-and-society/sts-360-ethnography-spring-2003/sts-360s03.jpg")
```

---

# Participant observation:
- A qualitative method for gathering data that involves developing a sustained relationship with people while they go about their normal activities.

```{r out.width="33%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/observation.png")
```

---

## Intensive (depth) interviewing:

- A qualitative method that involves open-ended, relatively unstructured questioning in which the interviewer seeks in-depth information on the interviewee’s feelings, experiences, and perceptions.

--

## Focus groups:

- A qualitative method that involves unstructured group interviews in which the focus group leader actively encourages discussion among participants on the topics of interest.

---

# Qualitative data analysis:

- Techniques used to search and code textual, aural, and pictorial data and to explore relationships among the resulting categories.

---

# Most approaches to qualitative data analysis take five steps:

1. Documentation of the data and data collection

--

1. Conceptualization and coding

--

1. Examining relationships to show how one concept may influence another

--

1. Authenticating conclusions by evaluating alternative explanations, disconfirming evidence, and searching for negative cases

--

1. Reflexivity

---

## Computer-assisted qualitative data analysis:

- Analysis of textual, aural, or pictorial data using a special computer program that facilitates searching and coding text.
