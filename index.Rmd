# Social science methods help to avoid<sup>2</sup> :

-  `Overgeneralization:` Occurs when we unjustifiably conclude that what is true for some cases is true for all cases

--

- `Selective or Inaccurate Observation:` Choosing to look only at things that are in line with our preferences or beliefs.

--

-  `Illogical reasoning:` The premature jumping to conclusions or arguing on the basis of invalid assumptions.

--

- `Resistance to change:` The reluctance to change our ideas in light of new information.

# Four goals of social research are<sup>2</sup>:

1. `Description:` Research in which social phenomena are defined and described.

--

1. `Exploration:` Seeks to find out how people get along in the setting under question, what meanings they give to their actions, and what issues concern them. 

--

1. `Explanation:` Seeks to identify causes and effects of social phenomena and to predict how one phenomenon will change or vary in response to variation in another phenomenon.

--

1. `Evaluation:` Research that describes or identifies the impact of social policies and programs.

---

# How well have we done our research?

- `Validity:` The state that exists when statements or conclusions about empirical reality are correct.

--

- Three kinds of validity:
  - `Measurement validity`: Exists when an indicator measures what we think it measures.

--

  - `Causal validity` (Internal validity): Exists when a conclusion that A leads to, or results in, B is correct.
  
--

  - `Generalizability`: Exists when a conclusion holds true for the population, group, settings, or event that we say it does, given the conditions that we specify; it is the extent to which a study can inform us about persons, places, or events that were not directly studies.

---

# Outcomes:

- Determining your research approach

--

- Identifying a worldview with which you are most comfortable

--

- Defining the three types of research approaches

--

- Using quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods designs and methods

---

# Research approach

- "Research approaches are **plans and the procedures** for research that span the steps from broad assumptions to
detailed methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation."

---

# Research approach depends upon:

- `Research designs`: procedures of inquiry as per the philosophical assumptions

--

- `Research methods`<sup>1</sup> of data collection, analysis and interpretation

--

- `Research problem`
